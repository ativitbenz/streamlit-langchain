## Your personal effectivity booster
Generative AI is considered to bring the next Industrial Revolution.

Why? Studies show a **37% efficiency boost** in day to day work activities!

#### What is this app?
This app is a Chat Agent which takes into account Enterprise Context to provide meaningfull and contextual responses.
Why is this a big thing? It is because the underlying Foundational Large Language Models are not trained on Enterprise Data. They have no way of knowing anything about your organization.
Also they are trained upon a moment in time, so typically miss out on relevant and recent information.

#### What does it know?
De app has been pre-loaded with the follpowing information:
- [DataStax homepage](https://www.datastax.com)
